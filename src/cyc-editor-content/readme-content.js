# Hello coder!

## How to change your Visual Studio Code theme

This editor is not perfect, so you'll probably want to fine tune your downloaded
theme by customizing "workbench.colorCustomizations" in your settings before
creating your own theme (optional).

## Under the hood

This editor is a little experiment made with Web Components using Polymer 3,
Visual Studio Code (obviously), and... ok, Sublime Text ‚ù§ :)

The base theme is [Electron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kuscamara.electron)
